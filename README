Entice 0.9.3

Entice is an image viewer using enlightenment libraries. You need CVS

Simple installation insturctions in INSTALL

Entice currently takes no commandline options. It takes as arguments a
list of images to load. Run with no arguments it tries to load all files
from the working directory (currently it even tries files that aren't
images). You can instead give a directory name as a single argument, and
it will load all images from this directory.

Entice will generate a ~/.entice.db file the first time you run it
This file contains your keybinds, evas rendering engine, and preferred theme

Theme: /entice/theme
* Entice will try to load the filename here in this order.
 - 1. Whether the path is absolute or relative and the file exists
 - 2. Whether the file exists in ~/.entice/
 - 3. Whether the file exists in $PACKAGE_DATA_DIR/themes/
 - 4. Otherwise it falls back to the default theme
Engine: /entice/engine - int
 - 1. Set this to 0 for software rendering
 - 2. Set this to 1 for gl rendering
Keys: This is slightly more complex
  * /entice/keys/[down|up]/[0-9]+/signal - the signal emission to emit
  * /entice/keys/[down|up]/[0-9]+/symbol - the key that emits this signal

  Ideally you'll be able to rebind your keys dynamically in entice in the
  future. =)
